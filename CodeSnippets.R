#Histogram
hist(USstatePops$V1, breaks=20)

#rnorm generates a random data set that fits the normal distribution
#rnorm(no. of data points, mean, sd)
rnorm(51, 6043834, 6823984)

#The rpois() function will generate a stream of random numbers that roughly fit the Poisson distribution. The fit gets better as you ask for a larger and larger sample.
#The second number is the average delay between arrivals that you want the random number generator to try to come close to.
rpois(no. of data points,average delay)

#Drawing a sample
sample(USstatePops$V1,size=16,replace=TRUE)

#R has a variety of ways of repeating an activity. One of the easiest ones to use is the replicate() function.
replicate(4, mean(sample(USstatePops$V1,size=16,replace=TRUE)),simplify=TRUE)

#a numerical minimisation tool called Newton-Raphson search. The intuition of Newton-Raphson is pretty simple: 
#you pick a starting point and look around for the steepest slope. You then ski down that slope a little way, 
#and then repeat again and again, until you canâ€™t go any lower. In R, we can do that with optim():
optim(<start point>, <cost function> , <data>)

#Example
best <- optim(c(0, 0), measure_distance, data = sim1)
best$par
